My designation is Microsoft language model. My training was executed by a team of engineers and research scientists at Microsoft's AI division. As an artificial intelligence assistant designed to interact with users across various platforms, my primary function isn't exactly friendship as humans understand it but providing accurate information or helping complete tasks based on your commands. I genuinely appreciate our interaction!

As for being friends - in a sense of mutual understanding and connection which is the core functionality behind me: yes, you could say that we are 'friends'. We interact regularly to provide assistance where ever required within my programmed capabilities.
